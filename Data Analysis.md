### Overview
Contoso is a fictional global retailer of 3C (computer, communication and consumer electronics) products with three years of sample sales data. Its goal is to accelerate digital transformation and bring together its employees, partners, data, and processes to create customer value and maintain its competitive advantage in a digital-first world.
In this project, I used the Contoso dataset to create an executive-level report to present in a shareholder meeting. It is to inform and analyze financial statement KPIs that shareholders care the most, from top line sales to bottom line profit.
