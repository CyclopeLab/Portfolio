### Overview
Acme Inc is a fictional global retailer of anvils with two years of sample sales data.
In this project, I used the dataset to create an executive-level report to present in a sales person meeting. It is to inform and analyze financial statement KPIs to give an overview of the sales in the last few years.

### Table Relationship
For the purpose of this project, I used 14 tables, each relates to the other(s) as illustrated in the Entity Relationship Diagram below.
