### Overview
Acme Inc is a fictional global retailer of anvils with two years of sample sales data.
In this project, I used the dataset to create an executive-level report to present in a sales person meeting. It is to inform and analyze financial statement KPIs to give an overview of the sales in the last few years.



### Database Model
For the purpose of this project, I used 4 tables, each relates to the other(s) as illustrated in the Entity Relationship Diagram below.

In the original request, there was two excel worksheets:
EXT0070122021
Sheet3

To make the data more manageable I did these steps:
- Copied the original worksheets and hid the originals
- Rename the copies meaningfully:
  - Geo Data
  - Volume Data
- Cleaned up the data and transformed the data ranges into tables:
  - GeoByClient
  - VolumeByClient
- Added columns to the tables
- Created new tables for data manipulation:
  - GeoNames
  - Quaters
